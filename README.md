<h1 align="center">Hello! 👋 I'm Chiang Wen Xi :D </h1>

## 🎓 About Me:

i! I’m Chiang Wen Xi, an aspiring AI engineer, data scientist, and full-stack developer who enjoys building meaningful, real-world solutions. I’m especially passionate about applying data and machine learning to solve problems in healthcare and business analytics.

I’m currently pursuing a double degree in Accountancy and Data Science & AI at NTU, where I blend technical expertise with strategic thinking. 

My interests and work revolve around:
- 🧠 AI & Machine Learning — building intelligent systems and exploring model optimization
- 📊 Data Analytics & Data Engineering — uncovering patterns that drive smarter decisions
- 🏥 Health & Well-Being Tech — creating tools that support mental health, patient monitoring, and health data insights
- 💻 Full-Stack Development & Automation — turning ideas into end-to-end working products
  
Across my projects, I aim to combine data rigor, human-centered design, and scalable engineering — from mental-health monitoring platforms to predictive modelling pipelines and intelligent analytics systems.

Always excited to connect, collaborate, and create! 🚀
